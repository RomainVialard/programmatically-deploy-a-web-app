## Programmatically deploy an Apps Script web app

In 2012, the Google Apps Script team released the [Script service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/), which provided the ability to publish scripts as web app programmatically, using ScriptApp.getService().enable(). But soon after this become broken then deprecated due to different updates.

Thanks to updates of the [Apps Script API](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/) it is now possible again to programmatically deploy a web app.
